The SPICE syntax for an N-channel JFET model is:

.MODEL ModelName NJF(parameters)

where ModelName is a user-defined name for the model and parameters are a list of values that define the JFET's characteristics, such as beta, Vto, rd, and rs. 

An example of a JFET element in the netlist is Jname <drain> <gate> <source> ModelName.

Model definition

MODEL: A directive used to define a model.

ModelName: A unique name you assign to this specific JFET model.

NJF: Specifies that this is an N-channel Junction Field-Effect Transistor model.

(parameters): A list of key-value pairs that define the JFET's electrical properties.
	beta: The transconductance parameter.
	Vto: The pinch-off voltage.
	rd: The drain resistance.
	rs: The source resistance.
	is: Saturation current.
	lambda: Channel-length modulation parameter.
	cgs: Gate-source capacitance.
	cgd: Gate-drain capacitance.
	fc: Forward-bias cap voltage dependence coefficient.
	m: Cap coefficient variation with gate voltage.
	n: Coefficient for gate voltage dependence of capacitance.
	xti: Temperature dependence of saturation current. 

Element instance

Jname: A unique name for the JFET device instance in the circuit.
<drain>: The node connected to the drain terminal.
<gate>: The node connected to the gate terminal.
<source>: The node connected to the source terminal.
ModelName: The name of the model you are referencing

The syntax element DEV 10% LOT 60% is used in SPICE simulations to define statistical variations for device parameters, enabling worst-case and Monte Carlo analyses. 

These parameters define how much a specific model parameter (like a transistor's current gain or a resistor's value) can vary from its nominal value during a statistical simulation. This is crucial for checking circuit robustness and manufacturing yield. 

DEV (Deviation): This specifies the intra-die variation, which is the random mismatch between components on the same integrated circuit (die). The value 10% means the parameter can randomly vary by up to +/-10% from its nominal value due to local process variations.

LOT: This specifies the inter-die (or lot-to-lot) variation. This accounts for the systematic shift in parameters that affects all devices on an entire wafer or in a specific manufacturing batch (lot). The value 60% means the parameter's nominal value can vary by up to +/-60% from the global average value across different manufacturing lots.

IDSS CLASSIFICATION NOTE:

In a JFET datasheet, the IDSS classification note refers to the practice of the manufacturer sorting JFETs into different performance grades (often indicated by letters like A, B, C, or ranks like 6, 7) based on their specific, measured Zero-Gate-Voltage Drain Current. 

Understanding the Classification 

IDSS Definition: IDSS is the maximum current that can flow from the drain to the source when the gate-source voltage VGS is 0V (gate and source shorted together) and the JFET is in the saturation region.

Manufacturing Variability: The exact value of IDSS and the associated pinch-off voltage VGS can vary significantly even among JFETs of the same part number due to slight inconsistencies in the manufacturing process. This variability is inherent to JFETs and is comparable to the beta factor HFE in BJTs.

Binning/Grading: To provide designers with more predictable components for specific applications, manufacturers test the produced JFETs and group (or "bin") them into different classifications, each with a tighter range of IDSS values than the overall part number might suggest.

Practical Implications for Design

The classification allows designers to select the appropriate JFET grade for their circuit, particularly when the design depends on a specific current range or requires matched pairs for differential amplifiers.
