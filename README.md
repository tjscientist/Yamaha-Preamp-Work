# Yamaha Electric Grand (CP-70 and CP-80) Preamp Work

This all started out as a "simple" CP-80 restoration and (as usual) turned into a year long project... And still continues. Once I started really digging into things, I realized I needed to document my work both in words and video. Initially this documentation was simply so I remembered what I was doing but eventually, I realized there were others out there struggling with the same issues I had been running into. These issues are primarily spare parts, readable schematics, and in depth repair knowledge. To that end, I decided to put my work up here on github so that others could not only benefit from what I have done, but also point out any mistakes I may be making as well as contribute their own knowledge.

What you see up here currently (as of November 2025) are a collection of files, specs, and simulations I have put together and am trying to get organized into something cohesive. Below I will delineate each section and what is in it. As always, please feel free to comment, ask questions, and/or add your own experiences.

## Altium Files

I use Altium in me every day life as my primary tool for designing electronic schematics and PCBs but I do understand that not everyone has access to this tool. If you do have access to Altium, you will find the entire schematic and part libraries in the **Altium Files** folder. On the other hand, if you do not have access to Altium, do not despair as you will find what is known as a Smart PDF of the schematic in the **Documents** folder named "Schematic - CP80 Preamp - SmartPDF."

## SmartPDF Schematic

The smartPDF schematic, named "Schematic - CP80 Preamp - SmartPDF", is a very useful document. In it you will find the preamp schematic which I have redrawn and find much more readable. But wait, there's more! By clicking on any part in the schematic, you will get a pop-up which includes the original part number, manufacturer, part description, and a comment field where I have listed what I suggest to use if you want or need to replace that particular part. Below is an example showing what appears when FET1 is clicked:

, equivalent parts to repair the amp, frequency response of the tone circuits and eventually a complete rebuild of the preamp using modern parts while maintaining the original sound.
